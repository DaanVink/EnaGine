# HTTP

## Introduction
This documents lays out the basic structure and flow of the handling of a request. It does not go into detail about the implementation of the various functions. For the implementation details refer to the [`implementation document`](../impl/http.MD).

## Request object
When a request is made, EnaGine creates a new Request object. This object is created by `event.c` and defined in `request.h` and holds information about the nature of the request. It contains the following attributes: 
* REQUESTQUERY - HTTP request query sent by the user
* REQUESTDATA - $-data attached to the query
* FILEPATH - Path to the file as resolved by EnaGine
* FOLDERPATH - Parent folder to the file. If the request asks for a folder instead of a file, it will be stored in here.
* FILETYPE - Extension of the file on disk
* MIMETYPE - MIME type of file as resolved by `httpTypeResolver.c`
* STATUS - HTTP status code
* ISBINARY - A boolean which says whether or not the file is plaintext or binary
* ISFOLDER - A boolean which says whether or not the requested item is a folder or file
* FILESIZE - Size of the response (Note: FILESIZE does **NOT** directly correspond with the size of the file on disk. For example: in the case the user requests a folder, it will be the size of the response generated by `index.c`)
